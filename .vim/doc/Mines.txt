1. Mines:						*mines*

Mines is a Vim plugin, but you may source it in on demand if you wish.
You'll need <Mines.vim> and <Rndm.vim> - the latter file is available
as "Rndm" at the following website:

    http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#VimFuncs


STARTING

    Games:						*mines-start*
        \mfc : clear statistics (when a game is not showing)
        \mfe : play an easy mines game
        \mfm : play a  medium-difficulty mines game
        \mfh : play a  high-difficulty mines game
        \mfr : restore a game

Note that using the \mf_ maps will save the files showing in all windows and
save your session.  Although I've used the backslash in the maps as shown here,
actually they use <Leader> so you may customize your maps as usual (see
|mapleader| for more about <Leader>).


USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

Mines.vim is a use-at-your-own-risk game.  However, an effort has been made
to preserve your files.  The game does a "windo w" and uses mksession to both
save your working files that are showing in your windows and to preserve your
window layout for subsequent restoration.


OBJECTIVE

The objective of the game is to flag all mines and to reveal all safe
squares.  As soon as you click a <leftmouse> or x, the square under the cursor
is revealed with either a count of the number of bombs around it or as a BOOM!
Of course, to use a mouse means your vim must support using the mouse.  Gvim
usually does; console vim may or may not depending on your supporting
terminal (see |'mouse'|).

Statistics are stored in <$HOME/.vimMines>.  You need to have a $HOME
environment variable set up properly for statistics to be kept.

If you win, Minnie will do a cartwheel for you!


GAME INTERFACE

On many terminals, all you need to do is to click with the left mouse (to see
what's there, or maybe to go BOOM!) or to click with the rightmouse to flag
what you think is a mine.

     -Play-						*mines-play*
        x  move the cursor around the field;
           pressing x is just like pressing a
           <leftmouse> -- find out what's
           hidden!
        f  just like the <rightmouse>, flag what's under the cursor as a mine
        0  goes to leftmost  position inside minefield
        $  goes to rightmost position inside minefield
        gg goes to uppermost position inside minefield
        G  goes to bttommost position inside minefield



     -Control-						*mines-control*
        C   clear statistics (only while a game is showing)
        s   suspend the game, restore the display
            and session  (\mfr will subsequently
            restore the game)

        q   quit the game, restore the display

     -New Games-					*mines-newgame*
        E   starts up a new easy game
            (only while an old game is showing)

        M   starts up a new medium game
            (only while an old game is showing)

        H   starts up a new hard game
            (only while an old game is showing)

3. Hints:						*mines-hints*

My own win rate with Mines is about 30%, so don't expect a sure fire
way-to-win!  However, here are some hints.  If you don't want to see them,
close your eyes!

	1-9 qty of bombs in vicinity
	#   any number
	o   any number or blank (no bomb) space
	?   unknown
	f   flag the space
	x   find out what's in the space

	 Pattern         Can Safely Do         Pattern         Can Safely Do
         ooooo             ooooo
         oo3oo             oo3oo             	oooo              oooo
	                    fff              	111o              111o
                                             	                    x

	+-----             +-----
	|ooo               |ooo              	oooo              oooo
	|22o..             |22o..            	122o              122o
	|??                |ffx              	                    f
