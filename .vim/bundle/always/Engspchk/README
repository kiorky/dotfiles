There are a fair number of ispell/aspell based spelling checkers out there -- but engspchk isn't one of them.  The engspchk source uses Vim's native syntax highlighting to catch spelling errors, so you get quick on-the-fly spellchecking!  An optional external program, agrep, may be used to suggest alternative spellings. With the optional <engspchk.rare> dictionary, <engspchk.vim> now provides over 186730 words (over 189000 when including proper names)!

Engspchk flags rare/unusual words and allows the user to specify his/her preferred dialect (let g:spchkdialect="usa", "uk", or "can").  Click-N-Fix by enabling the mouse (example: :set mouse=n) and a leftmouse click in the document will advance the cursor to the next spelling error; a leftmouse click in the alternative spellings window will substitute the selected word for the misspelled word.  A rightmouse click will do that substitute for all such misspellings in your file.

Engspchk is no longer English-only: it supports multiple languages.  You can tell it what language (dictionary) to use by either renaming it (ex.  engspchk.vim -> frspchk.vim for French) or by specifying the variable g:spchklang (ex. let g:spchklang="ger" for German).  See http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#vimlinks_scripts for some dictionaries: currently, that includes Dutch, French, Galician, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Yiddish.

The engspchk s/w includes maps for jumping to the next and preceding spelling errors, alternative spellings, and for saving words either permanently in a custom dictionary or just for the current session.

Engspchk's dictionaries are optional.  SpellChecker, for example, claims to load faster because it doesn't handle unusual words.  Merely deleting <CVIMSYN/engspchk.rare> will speed up loading (which is pretty fast anyway).  Both support flagging dialect-sensitive words, but only Engspchk has Click-N-Fix and rare word support.  Telling the difference between "or the" and "ort he" is easy -- the "ort" will show up with RareWord highlighting (default: black on cyan).

To begin checking your spelling with engspchk, and assuming that <engspchk.vim> has been put into your .vim/plugin directory, simply start up engspchk by applying the English Check map:

    \ec

and your spelling errors will show up highlighted in white-on-red.  Alternatively, if you're using gvim, select DrChip:Load Spelling Checker from the menu.

If you want to change languages, engspchk provides a lot of ways to help you:

  * set g:spchklang appropriately and \ec will load that language's dictionary.  The backslash is actually using <mapleader>, so you can customize the backslash to whatever you want.
  * you may embed a modeline at the beginning or at the end of the file:  ex. spchk: lang=nl.
  * using gvim, there's a "Load AltLang Spelling Checker" submenu for choosing whatever language(s) for which you have dictionaries!
  * engspchk looks over your dictionaries and constructs simple commands: :Engspchk  :Frspchk  :Gerspchk  :Nlspchk  :Spanspchk  etc,

It will work with some cooperating syntax files to check out spelling in comments, including:

amiga, bib, c, cpp, csh, d, dcl, dtml, elmfilt, exports, fortran, html, java, lex, lisp, mail, maple, sh, sm, smarty, tcsh, tex, vim, and xmath

If your favorite computer language isn't on that list, perhaps you can talk that language's maintainer into making it engspchk compatible.
