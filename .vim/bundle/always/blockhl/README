Blockhl.vim supports block-oriented highlighting of leading white space for C/C++.

For dark backgrounds, as one gets deeper into curly braces, the leading indentation will change to ever lighter colors (up to 7 such levels, then it cycles).

For light backgrounds, increasing curly brace depths will cause ever darker colors to be used (again, 7 levels).

You will need to source the <blockhl.vim> file in if you change colorschemes.

	Required: gvim
