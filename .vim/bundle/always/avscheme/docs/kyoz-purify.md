## Installation

You can install purify easily if you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'kyoz/purify', { 'rtp': 'vim' }
```

**Note**: Other vim plugin manager have similar installation, just remember about `rtp` option

Then add this to your vim config file:

```vim
syntax on " This is required
colorscheme purify
```

**Note**: All custom options should be placed before you call `colorscheme purify`. If not, it'll not have any effect.

### Airline

If you are using [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline):

```
let g:airline_theme='purify'
```

### Lightline

If you are using [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim):

```
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'purify',
      \ }
```

### Gitsigns.nvim

You don't have to do anything, just install [Gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) correctly


## Customize

### Font styles

By default, Purify will support for italic, bold, underline... You can disable them if you want:

```
let g:purify_bold = 0        " default: 1
let g:purify_italic = 0      " default: 1
let g:purify_underline = 0   " default: 1
let g:purify_undercurl = 0   " default: 1
let g:purify_inverse = 0     " default: 1
```

**Note**: Those style formats only working if your terminal, your settings, your fonts support em.

### Background

By default, Vim using your terminal background color as the background colors.

If you are using GUI version of vim/neovim, it'll have Purify Background (#252834), but if you are using terminal vim or neovim, you have to choose and set the background yourself:

```
colorscheme purify "--------------------------------- Set onedark theme
hi Normal guibg=#252834 ctermbg=234 "---- Place this after you set the colorscheme
```

P/s: If you are nvim-qt, you may need set this to your `ginit.vim`

```
set background=dark
```

### Override colors

You can override purify's colors if there are some colors you don't like:

```
let g:purify_override_colors = {
    \ 'pink':  { 'gui': '#FF87FF', 'cterm': '213' },
    \ 'green': { 'gui': '#5FD700', 'cterm': '76' }
\ }
```

## Why I have to install other plugins

- Purify is only aim for colorscheme, I've tried my best to make purify colorscheme look the same for all languages supported by vim, neovim.

- But for new languages, frameworks... you have to install other plugins to have correct syntax, I'll try my best to support plugins that have a good syntax for new languages, frameworks like React, Vue...
