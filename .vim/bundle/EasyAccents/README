EasyAccents makes entering accented characters easy in insert mode.  Of course there are many European keyboards that have accented characters on keys, but US-style keyboards don't.  During insert mode,  a' becomes an accented a, etc.  It works with utf8 encoding.

EasyAccents may be toggled on and off with:
  :EZA

You can get just the two characters o', for example, by simply escaping the ':  o&#039 -> o'

History/Features:

v5: included g:EasyAccents_VowelFirst option
    fixed insert vs append bug

v4: EasyAccents handles a' a` A' o: etc : during insert mode, these pairs of
characters become the associated accented characters.  Use <Leader>ea (\ea) to
toggle EasyAccents on and off.  Especially helpful for US style keyboards.
