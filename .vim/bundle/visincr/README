The visincr plugin facilitates making a column of increasing or decreasing
numbers, dates, or daynames.

First, select a column using visual-block (ctrl-v) and move the cursor.

Second, choose what sort of incremented list you want:

    :I [#]  Will use the first line's number as a starting point to build
            a column of increasing numbers (or decreasing numbers if the
        increment is negative).
        Default increment: 1
        Justification    : left (will pad on the right)

    :II [# [zfill]]  Will use the first line's number as a starting point
        to build a column of increasing numbers (or decreasing numbers
        if the increment is negative).
        Default increment: 1
        Justification    : right (will pad on the left)
        Zfill            : left padding will be done with the given
                           character, typically a zero.

    :IYMD [#]    year/month/day
    :IMDY [#]    month/day/year
    :IDMY [#]    day/month/year
        Will use the starting line's date to construct an increasing
        or decreasing list of dates, depending on the sign of the
        number.
        Default increment: 1 (in days)

    :ID [#] Will produce an increasing/decreasing list of daynames.  Three-letter
            daynames will be used if the first day on the first line is a three
        letter dayname; otherwise, full names will be used.

    :IO [#]
    :IIO [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visincr creates octal numbers.

    :IR [#]
    :IIR [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visincr uses Roman numerals.  Negative and
        zero counts are not supported for Roman numerals.

    :IX [#]
    :IIX [#] [zfill]
        Like :I and :II, except visincr creates hexadecimal numbers.

    -------------------
    EXTRA NOTES
    -------------------
    For :I :II :IO :IIO :IR :IIR :
        If the visual block is ragged on the right-hand side (as can
        easily happen when the "$" is used to select the
        right-hand-side), the block will have spaces appended to
        straighten it out.  If the string length of the count exceeds
        the visual-block, then additional spaces will be inserted as
        needed.  Leading tabs are handled by using virtual column
        calculations.

    For :IR and :IIR :
        Since Roman numerals vary considerably in their lengths for
        nearby numbers, an additional two spaces will be included.

    For :IYMD, :IMDY, and IDMY:
        You'll need the <calutil.vim> plugin, available as
        "Calendar Utilities" under the following url:
